ICON PLACEHOLDER

For now, the extension will work without icons, but Chrome will show a default icon.

To create proper icons for Chrome Web Store submission, you need:

- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon32.png (32x32 pixels) 
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can:
1. Design icons using tools like Figma, Canva, or Photoshop
2. Use online icon generators
3. Use AI tools to generate icons
4. Find free icons on sites like Iconify or Feather Icons

Icon suggestions:
- A simple HTML tag symbol ("</>")
- A database/storage icon
- A download/extract arrow icon
- Combination of HTML and database symbols

Make sure icons are:
- Clear and recognizable at small sizes
- Consistent in style across all sizes
- Follow Chrome extension icon guidelines
